A website for Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Voices: Show choir.
 
## Design Process

As a member of the Voices club:
I want to learn more about the club's activities and events on the "About Us" page so that I can stay informed and actively participate in club events.

As a prospective member of Voices:
I want to understand the benefits of joining the Voices club so that I can decide whether it aligns with my interests and goals.

As a user interested in show choir performances:
I want to know when the next performance is scheduled so that I can plan to attend and support NPVSC.
